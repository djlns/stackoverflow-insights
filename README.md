# Stack Overflow Insights

## Project Motivation

Since 2012 [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) has conducted an Annual Developer survey that covers everything from favourite technologies to questions about careers, salaries and job preferences. In 2020 around 65,000 developers participated in the 20 minute survey, making it an unparalleled source of information regarding the field.

For this project I was interested in studying trends over time by comparing the surveys from 2012 to 2020.

## Installation

Environment: Python 3.8+ with jupyter + pandas + matplotlib + scikit-learn

Each year's survey is contained in a separate .csv file. These files can be accessed [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and should be placed in the root folder.
