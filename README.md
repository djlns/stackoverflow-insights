# Stack Overflow Insights

## Project Motivation

Since 2012 [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) has conducted an Annual Developer survey that covers everything from favourite technologies to questions about careers, salaries and job preferences. In 2020 around 65,000 developers participated in the 20 minute survey, making it an unparalleled source of information regarding the field.

For this project I was interested in studying trends over time by comparing the surveys from 2012 to 2020. In particular I was interesting in the following questions:

1. What are the notable changes in demographics - age, gender country, industry, salaries?
2. How has the usage of programming languages evolved?
3. Do the contributing factors to salaries also change?
4. Have personal behaviours changed - satisfaction and tech choices.

How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field?
What was the state of bootcamps for assisting individuals with breaking into developer roles?
How were bootcamps assisting with increasing diversity in tech careers?

## Installation

Environment: Python 3.8+ with jupyter + pandas + matplotlib + scikit-learn

Each year's survey is contained in a separate .csv file. These files can be accessed [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and should be unzipped into a folder named "surveys" in the root of the project.
